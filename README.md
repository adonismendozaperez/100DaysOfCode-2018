# My 100 days of code challenge 2018

# Why?
Because I need to improve my programming skills and also to know new languages and tools.

I will also do it as one of my personal purposes and to prove to myself that if I can.

# The rules
I vow to code for a total of one hour per day. This will be done in one or more sessions.

This coding time will be used to build portfolio and personal projects, and not client work. It may include tutorials that involve following along while coding. Just watching the videos doesn't count. Writing pseudo code does count.

Writing coding tutorials for my blog may count towards the total time, but can not make up more than half of the total time spent (30 minutes max).

On travel days I will miss no more than two full days. Any days missed will be added onto the end of the challenge until 100 coding days has been reached.

Acceptable reasons for missing a day:

* Travelling on plane/train/car over distance
* Nursing sick children
* Loss of limbs / or serious hand injury.
* Death

Code is to be pushed to Github or Bitbucket (for private repos) daily. Not all code will be in this repo. Projects may require their own repo, in which case the links to those will be placed in the section below.

# Stuff I want to learn or beef up

* Css3
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* React
* Redux
* Data Visualization with D3 or Chartjs
* Docker

# Schedule / What I did
my activity diary will take them in a file called diary.md

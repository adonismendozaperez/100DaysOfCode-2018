### R1D0
I started with the content offered by the FreecodeCamp platform, specifically with the basic Css program that is within the Responsive Web Design Certification certification (300 hours), I started with this part because I feel a bit weak with the design part.

-Complete the basic concepts of css part of this program.

### R1D1 
I started with the content of Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges, where I will be seeing some css properties, which are used a lot when designing.

-Also get fully understand the functionality of the keyframes.

### R1D2 
I started with the content of the Applied Accessibility Challenges, where I'll be seeing some
html properties, such as <time datetime = "2018-08-06"> </ time> that totally ignores it and also I was what is the alternative text in the images, also with reference to this topic He indicated when I should use it and when not.

### R1D3
Finish with the content of the Applied Accessibility Challenges, Where I was looking at some html properties, in this content, I did not see anything new, like yesterday, I do not feel totally satisfied :(

### R1D9
Today I could only solve several cases of users because I have some problems.

### R1D10

I started on August 4, Saturday, 2018.

### R1D0
I started with the content offered by the FreecodeCamp platform, specifically with the basic Css program that is within the Responsive Web Design Certification certification (300 hours), I started with this part because I feel a bit weak with the design part.

-Until now I've been designing the example of (CatPhotoApp).
-Complete the basic concepts of css part of this program.

### R1D1 
I started with the content of Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges, where I will be seeing some css properties, which are used a lot when designing.

-I finished this section and learned several concepts, which I did not know existed, such as:
   * Animation-timing-function
-Also get fully understand the functionality of the keyframes.

### R1D2 
I started with the content of the Applied Accessibility Challenges, where I'll be seeing some
html properties, such as <time datetime = "2018-08-06"> </ time> that totally ignores it and also I was what is the alternative text in the images, also with reference to this topic He indicated when I should use it and when not.

### R1D3
Finish with the content of the Applied Accessibility Challenges, Where I was looking at some html properties, in this content, I did not see anything new, like yesterday, I do not feel totally satisfied :(

### R1D4 
I started and finished with the responsive design part, and also started with a very interesting topic that is flexbox, here is an example of what we can do with flexbox.

### R1D5
Finalize the Flexbox module, I feel super with what I learned in this section, I also finalized the css Grids module, it also seemed super, I also started with one of the final projects of this section, called Survey Form.

### R1D6
Continue working on one of the final projects of this section, called Survey Form, and finish the design, I just have to solve 3 user stories.

### R1D7
Continue working on one of the final projects in this section, called Survey Form, and finish the design, and also complete the user's stories.

### R1D8
Start working on another of the final project of this section, called Product Landing Page, which tries to serve information of a product, I in my case decided to talk about Reacjs.

### R1D9
Today I could only solve several cases of users because I have some problems.

### R1D10
Today I was able to finish the Product Landing Page Project, locally I did not tell any stories of users as resolved, and when I uploaded codepen.io if it is working for me, so I see this FCC testing is not fully functional.

### R1D11
I was working on the project Technical Documentation Page, and at the end it did not seem fair in some user history of this project, because the structure of the HTML that they asked for did not seem the most convenient.

### R1D12
I was working on the Personal Portfolio project, today I was finishing this project, although I know that I will make many improvements to this Portfolio.

### R1D13
Today I started working with javascript, specifically with the basic concepts, I have intermediate knowledge of javascript, what I learned new in this section was the Do .. while, and also the parseInt (string, 2) that you can get the root of this form.

### R1D14
Today I finished the basic javascript section and now enter the module of ES6, so far I have not learned anything new with ES6 because I had already studied this topic.

### R1D15
Today working at ES6 with Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects and Arrays, honestly are not practice this lesson in the real life or not frequently.

### R1D16
Today I finished the session es6, some what i liked of this session is Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters, is very useful.

### R1D17 
Today I was working with Regex (regular expressions) this session was not completed, but I learned about this terminology and how to used.

### R1D18
Tonight I finished the Regex session, and I really learned a lot, this topic is very useful and it is used a lot to do validations.

### R1D23
Tonight init the section Object Oriented Programming, I learned of the constructor and Inheritance.

### R1D24
Tonight I Finished the section Object Oriented Programming, in this section I learned receive, or inherit, all the features from a base or parent class. This helps to reduce repeated code.

### R1D25
Today I started working with the Functional Programming session, in this session I think I will study it more carefully because what little I have read I think it is worth dedicating its time, because it is like a series of methodologies to improve the way programs.

### R1D26
